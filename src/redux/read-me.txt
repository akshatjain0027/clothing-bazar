All the states related to our app is present in the redux folder.
All these states are combined into single reducer in the root-reducer.js file.
All the middlewares are set up in the store.js file. The store is also created in the store.js file.

A reducer is just a function that gets two properties; state object(that represents the last/current state) and action object(that tells what action is to be performed on the state).
